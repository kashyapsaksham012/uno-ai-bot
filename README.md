# 🤖 UNO Bot – Unstop Coding Challenge Submission

This repository contains a Python-based UNO-playing bot built for the **Unstop Submission Round – April 2025**. The bot's logic is implemented by editing the `choose_card()` function inside the provided starter kit (`playerBot.py`), as per the challenge instructions.

## 🧠 Bot Logic

The core logic is written in the `choose_card()` function located in `playerBot.py`. The bot evaluates the top card on the pile and chooses a card from its hand based on UNO rules. If no valid move exists, it returns `None` to indicate a draw.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can test the bot in **two different ways**:

### 1. Manual Input (Single Turn Test)
```bash
python playerBot.py
